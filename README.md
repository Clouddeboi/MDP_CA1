# MDP_CA1
A 2D physics-based shooter game inspired mainly by Rounds. The core gameplay loop is designed around short competitive rounds between two players. The game focuses on fast-paced rounds, responsive controls, and physics-based movement.

# Current Issue/Bugs
- Dust particles randomly "connect" between players
- Collisions sometimes fail whenever game is loaded, they work when game is relaunched (this happens rarely)
- Re-mapping controls works only for keyboard (no compatability with mouse or gamepad)
