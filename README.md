### Disclaimer!!!
This project was done solo, therefore all additional code is written by me and with occasional help from github's copilot for students (the agent used was Claude Sonnet 4.5).
### Game Description
A 2D physics-based shooter game inspired mainly by Rounds. The core gameplay loop is designed around short competitive rounds between two players. The game focuses on fast-paced rounds, responsive controls, and physics-based movement.

## Current Issue/Bugs
- Dust particles randomly "connect" between players
- Collisions sometimes fail whenever game is loaded, they work when game is relaunched (this happens rarely)
- Re-mapping controls works only for keyboard (no compatability with mouse or gamepad)
